# This software is a simple RSS feeds Reader written in PHP.

==============================
# This is the first part of coursework of INFO 6005 at University of Southampton, year of 2012.
# Students are expected to package the existing code for distribution on debian or ubuntu platform.

==============================
Install:
  If you have installed php (>=5) already

	run 'sudo dpkg -i cw1-6005-fw3e11.deb'
  or
	run 'sudo apt-get -f install' to install dependencies beforehand.

Usage:
	get_news # which equals 'php index.php'

==============================
Note:

  In the beginning of this coursework, I think control and rules files are the most important and difficult part because the 'debian maintainers guide' is too much to read and to understand, before I found a Debian Package Tutorial authored by Lucas Nussbaum. Then I was focusing on the hierarchical file systems, so I had to change the index.php code in the aspect of feeds.conf when the 'No feeds sepecified' appeared. I made some mistakes at that time. I also need a command to run the programme after install the .deb file so I google 'unix shell language'.
  Updated changelog is a record reflecting my progress all the way. The history of the commits in github can be found in https://github.com/fw3e11/6005_cw1_fw3e11/commits/master.
